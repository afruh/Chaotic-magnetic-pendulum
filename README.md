simulation of one of the problem IPT 2022

## subject : 
Consider a pendulum consisting of a magnetic bob attached to a string. If the pendulum is allowed to swing over a structure of permanent magnets, it will display complex motion. Study the pendulum dynamics and its dependence on the number of permanent magnets and their arrangement.
